            content: `In programming, different types of information are stored in different ways. Think of data types as different containers for different kinds of things.

**String (Text)**
Strings are sequences of characters - letters, numbers, symbols, or spaces. They're always enclosed in quotes.

Examples:
• "Hello, Zambia!"
• "Lusaka is the capital"
• "Grade 11 Computer Studies"

**Integer (Whole Numbers)**
Integers are whole numbers without decimal points. They can be positive, negative, or zero.

Examples:
• 42 (age)
• -10 (temperature below zero)
• 0 (starting point)

**Float (Decimal Numbers)**
Floats are numbers with decimal points, used for precise measurements.

Examples:
• 3.14159 (pi)
• 98.6 (body temperature in Fahrenheit)
• 15.5 (distance in kilometers)

**Boolean (True/False)**
Booleans represent yes/no, on/off, true/false values.

Examples:
• True (student is present)
• False (assignment not submitted)

**Lists (Collections)**
Lists store multiple items in a single variable, like a shopping list.

Examples:
• ["apple", "banana", "orange"] (fruits)
• [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] (numbers)
• ["Lusaka", "Ndola", "Kitwe"] (Zambian cities)`,

            content: `Programs need to make decisions and repeat actions. Control structures help us control the flow of our program.

**If Statements - Making Decisions**
If statements let programs make choices based on conditions.

Basic structure:
if condition:
    # do something
elif another_condition:
    # do something else
else:
    # do this if nothing else matches

Real example:
temperature = 25
if temperature > 30:
    print("It's hot today!")
elif temperature > 20:
    print("Nice weather!")
else:
    print("It's cool today")

**Loops - Repeating Actions**
Loops help us repeat code without writing it multiple times.

For loops (when you know how many times):
for i in range(5):
    print(f"Count: {i}")

While loops (repeat until condition is false):
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(f"Count: {count}")
    count += 1

**Functions - Organizing Code**
Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks.

def greet_student(name, grade):

# Using the function
message = greet_student("Chisomo", 11)

**Addition (+)**
Addition combines two or more numbers to find their total.

Basic addition facts:
• 5 + 3 = 8
• 12 + 7 = 19
• 25 + 15 = 40

Properties of addition:
• Commutative: 5 + 3 = 3 + 5
• Associative: (2 + 3) + 4 = 2 + (3 + 4)
• Identity: Any number + 0 = that number

Real-world examples:
• If you have 15 kwacha and earn 25 more, you have 15 + 25 = 40 kwacha
• A bus travels 120 km to Ndola and 80 km further to Kitwe: 120 + 80 = 200 km total

**Subtraction (-)**
Subtraction finds the difference between numbers or removes a quantity.

Basic subtraction facts:
• 8 - 3 = 5
• 19 - 7 = 12
• 40 - 15 = 25

Properties of subtraction:
• Not commutative: 8 - 3 ≠ 3 - 8
• Identity: Any number - 0 = that number
• Inverse of addition: If 5 + 3 = 8, then 8 - 3 = 5

Real-world examples:
• You have 50 kwacha and spend 20 kwacha: 50 - 20 = 30 kwacha remaining
• A journey of 200 km with 75 km completed: 200 - 75 = 125 km remaining

**Adding and Subtracting Larger Numbers**
Use column method for multi-digit numbers:

Example: 347 + 256
  347
+ 256
-----
  603

Example: 523 - 187
  523
- 187
-----
  336

**Word Problems**
Practice with real situations:

1. A school has 245 students in Grade 10 and 198 students in Grade 11. How many students total?
   Answer: 245 + 198 = 443 students

2. A farmer harvested 850 kg of maize and sold 320 kg. How much remains?

            title: 'Multiplication and Division',
            content: `Multiplication and division help us work with groups and equal parts efficiently.

**Multiplication (×)**
Multiplication is repeated addition - adding the same number multiple times.

Basic multiplication facts:
• 3 × 4 = 12 (same as 3 + 3 + 3 + 3)
• 7 × 6 = 42
• 9 × 8 = 72

Properties of multiplication:
• Commutative: 3 × 4 = 4 × 3
• Associative: (2 × 3) × 4 = 2 × (3 × 4)
• Identity: Any number × 1 = that number
• Zero property: Any number × 0 = 0

Multiplication table patterns:
• 2 times table: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12...
• 5 times table: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30...
• 10 times table: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60...

Real-world examples:
• 6 packets of biscuits with 8 biscuits each: 6 × 8 = 48 biscuits
• A classroom has 5 rows of 7 desks: 5 × 7 = 35 desks
• Working 8 hours per day for 5 days: 8 × 5 = 40 hours

**Division (÷)**
Division splits a number into equal groups or finds how many times one number fits into another.

Basic division facts:
• 12 ÷ 3 = 4 (12 split into 3 equal groups)
• 42 ÷ 7 = 6
• 72 ÷ 8 = 9

Properties of division:
• Not commutative: 12 ÷ 3 ≠ 3 ÷ 12
• Identity: Any number ÷ 1 = that number
• Inverse of multiplication: If 3 × 4 = 12, then 12 ÷ 3 = 4

Types of division:
• Exact division: 15 ÷ 3 = 5 (no remainder)
• Division with remainder: 17 ÷ 3 = 5 remainder 2

Real-world examples:
• 48 students divided into 6 equal groups: 48 ÷ 6 = 8 students per group
• 150 kwacha shared equally among 5 people: 150 ÷ 5 = 30 kwacha each
• 84 books arranged on 7 shelves: 84 ÷ 7 = 12 books per shelf

**Long Division**
For larger numbers, use the long division method:

Example: 156 ÷ 12
    13
   ----
12 | 156
     12
     ---
      36

            content: `Variables are letters that represent unknown numbers. Algebraic expressions combine variables with numbers and operations.

**Understanding Variables**
Variables are like empty boxes waiting to be filled:

• x, y, z are common variable names
• Variables can represent any number
• The same variable always represents the same value in one problem

Examples:
• Let x = the number of students in a class
• Let y = the cost of one textbook
• Let t = time in hours

**Algebraic Expressions**
Expressions combine variables, numbers, and operations:

Simple expressions:
• x + 5 (a number plus 5)
• 3y (3 times a number)
• 2x - 7 (twice a number minus 7)
• x² + 4 (a number squared plus 4)

Complex expressions:
• 2x + 3y - 5 (combining multiple variables)
• 4(x + 2) (using parentheses for grouping)
• x² + 2x + 1 (quadratic expression)

**Evaluating Expressions**
To evaluate means to find the value when variables have specific numbers:

If x = 3, evaluate 2x + 5:
• 2x + 5
• 2(3) + 5
• 6 + 5
• 11

If a = 4 and b = 2, evaluate 3a - b:
• 3a - b
• 3(4) - 2
• 12 - 2
• 10

**Terms and Coefficients**
Understanding the parts of expressions:

In the expression 5x + 3y - 2:
• Terms: 5x, 3y, and -2
• Coefficients: 5 (coefficient of x), 3 (coefficient of y)
• Constant: -2 (the number without a variable)
• Variables: x and y

**Like Terms**
Terms with the same variable can be combined:

Like terms:
• 3x and 5x can combine to 8x
• 2y and -4y can combine to -2y
• 7 and 3 can combine to 10

Unlike terms (cannot be combined):
• 3x and 5y (different variables)
• x² and x (different powers)
• 4xy and 3x (different variable combinations)

**Simplifying Expressions**
Combine like terms to make expressions simpler:

Example 1: 3x + 5x - 2
• Combine like terms: (3 + 5)x - 2
• Result: 8x - 2

Example 2: 4y + 3 - 2y + 7
• Group like terms: (4y - 2y) + (3 + 7)
• Result: 2y + 10

**Real-World Applications**
Algebra helps solve practical problems:

• If textbooks cost 25 kwacha each, the cost for x textbooks is 25x
• If a bus travels at 60 km/h for t hours, distance = 60t
• If you save s kwacha per month for 12 months, total savings = 12s`,

            title: 'Steps of the Scientific Method',
            content: `The scientific method follows a logical sequence of steps that help scientists understand the natural world.

**Step 1: Observation**
Scientists begin by carefully observing the world around them.

Examples of observations:
• Plants grow taller when placed near windows
• Some materials float while others sink
• Birds migrate at certain times of year
• Water boils at different temperatures at different altitudes

Good observations are:
• Detailed and specific
• Measurable when possible
• Recorded accurately
• Made using multiple senses

**Step 2: Question**
Based on observations, scientists ask specific questions.

Examples of scientific questions:
• Why do plants grow toward light?
• What determines whether an object floats?
• How do birds know when to migrate?
• Why does water boil at different temperatures?

Good scientific questions:
• Can be tested through experiments
• Are specific and focused
• Have measurable outcomes
• Lead to further investigation

**Step 3: Hypothesis**
A hypothesis is an educated guess that answers the question.

Characteristics of a good hypothesis:
• Based on existing knowledge
• Testable through experiments
• Specific and measurable
• Can be proven right or wrong

Examples:
• "Plants grow toward light because they need light for photosynthesis"
• "Objects with lower density than water will float"
• "Birds migrate based on changes in daylight hours"

**Step 4: Experiment**
Design and conduct tests to check if the hypothesis is correct.

Elements of a good experiment:
• Control group: The standard for comparison
• Experimental group: The group being tested
• Variables: Factors that can change
• Constants: Factors kept the same

Example experiment:
Question: Do plants grow better with fertilizer?
Hypothesis: Plants with fertilizer will grow taller
Control: Plants with no fertilizer
Experimental: Plants with fertilizer
Variable: Amount of fertilizer
Constants: Same light, water, soil, temperature

**Step 5: Data Collection and Analysis**
Record observations and measurements during the experiment.

Types of data:
• Quantitative: Numbers and measurements (height, weight, temperature)
• Qualitative: Descriptions and observations (color, texture, behavior)

Data analysis includes:
• Creating tables and graphs
• Calculating averages
• Looking for patterns
• Comparing results

**Step 6: Conclusion**
Determine whether the hypothesis was supported or not.

A good conclusion:
• States whether hypothesis was supported
• Explains what the data shows
• Discusses possible sources of error
• Suggests further experiments

**Step 7: Communication**
Share results with other scientists and the public.

Methods of communication:
• Scientific papers and journals
• Conferences and presentations
• Reports and summaries
• Educational materials

**The Cycle Continues**
Science is an ongoing process:
• New questions arise from conclusions
• Other scientists repeat experiments
• Theories develop from multiple studies
• Knowledge builds over time`,
