    question: "What is the value of x in the equation 2x + 5 = 13?",
    options: ["x = 3", "x = 4", "x = 5", "x = 6"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "To solve 2x + 5 = 13, subtract 5 from both sides: 2x = 8, then divide by 2: x = 4",
    eagleTip: "\uD83E\uDD85 Always isolate the variable by doing the same operation to both sides!"

    question: "What is the area of a circle with radius 5 units?",
    options: ["25\u03C0", "10\u03C0", "15\u03C0", "20\u03C0"],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Area of circle = \u03C0r\u00B2. With r = 5, Area = \u03C0 \u00D7 5\u00B2 = 25\u03C0",
    eagleTip: "\uD83E\uDD85 Remember the formula A = \u03C0r\u00B2 - the radius is squared, not doubled!"

    question: "If a triangle has angles of 60\u00B0 and 70\u00B0, what is the third angle?",
    options: ["40\u00B0", "50\u00B0", "60\u00B0", "70\u00B0"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Sum of angles in a triangle = 180\u00B0. Third angle = 180\u00B0 - 60\u00B0 - 70\u00B0 = 50\u00B0",
    eagleTip: "\uD83E\uDD85 The three angles of any triangle always add up to 180 degrees!"

    question: "What is the slope of the line passing through points (2, 3) and (4, 7)?",
    options: ["1", "2", "3", "4"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Slope = (y\u2082 - y\u2081) / (x\u2082 - x\u2081) = (7 - 3) / (4 - 2) = 4 / 2 = 2",
    eagleTip: "\uD83E\uDD85 Rise over run - how much the line goes up for each step to the right!"

    question: "What is 15% of 200?",
    options: ["25", "30", "35", "40"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "15% of 200 = 0.15 \u00D7 200 = 30",
    eagleTip: "\uD83E\uDD85 To find a percentage, multiply the number by the percentage as a decimal!"
